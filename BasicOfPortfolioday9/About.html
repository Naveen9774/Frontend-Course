Hello!I'm Karipisetty Naveen, a recent graduate with a Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) in
Computer Science and Engineering (CSE)With a strong foundation in software development, I
specialize as a Full Stack Developer, proficient in technologies such as Java, HTML, CSS, 
JavaScript, and MySQL, along with a basic knowledge of Python.Throughout my academic journey
I completed a 2-month internship at Upskills Campus, where I gained hands-on experience in 
Java and core programming principles. This experience was instrumental in developing my final
year project,a Credit Card Fraud Detection system, which utilized machine learning techniques 
to address real-world challenges.I've also completed key coursework, including Core Java, 
which enhanced my skills and confidence in software development.I am passionate about expanding
my technical expertise and exploring new, challenging roles in software and web development.
