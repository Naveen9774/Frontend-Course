Hello..! I'm Karipisetty Naveen, a recent graduate with a Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) 
in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) With a strong foundation in software development,
I specialize as a Full Stack Developer, proficient in technologies such as Java, HTML, CSS, 
JavaScript, and MySQL, along with a basic knowledge of Python.Throughout my academic journey, 
I completed a 2-month internship at Upskills Campus, where I gained hands-on experience in 
Java and core programming principles. This experience was instrumental in developing my final 
year project, a Credit Card Fraud Detection system, which utilized machine learning techniques 
to address real-world challenges.I've also completed key coursework, including Core Java, which
enhanced my skills and confidence in software development. I am passionate about expanding my 
technical expertise and exploring new, challenging roles in software and web development.</pre></h1>
